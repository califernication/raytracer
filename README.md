# A brute-force ray tracer built in C++

This project is an implementation of Peter Shirley's brute force ray tracer, as described on his book series ["Ray Tracing in..."](https://raytracing.github.io/).

I found [Gabriel Gambetta's blog](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/02-basic-raytracing.html) helpful in its depiction of vectors and breakdown of mathematics. I recommend this source as a point of entry before building your own program.
